## About the Collection

 The J. Wayne and Elsie M. Gunn Center for the Study of Science Fiction (CSSF) was established in 1982 by KU professor and Grand Master of Science Fiction James Gunn. Since that time, CSSF has offered classes, sponsored creative writing prizes, and hosted symposia, readings, and other public events focused on the shared inquiry, celebration, and crafting of genres such as science fiction, fantasy, Afrofuturism, horror, speculative poetry, and neo-Gothic narratives. Despite the recent proliferation and some mainstream acknowledgement of speculative works by diverse authors (N.K. Jemisin, Tomi Adeyemi, Rivers Solomon, Darcie Little Badger, Rebecca Roanhorse, Aiden Thomas, and Silvia Moreno-Garcia, to name just a few), the conventional story of who writes and appreciates science fiction largely overlooks women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ communities. CSSF hopes to rectify and expand the narrative by promoting international speculative literatures—including creative work from Indian Nations, such as the Kaw and Osage. 

One of the little-known facts about CSSF, despite its longstanding presence on KU’s campus, is that it occupies a small physical space in Wescoe Hall—a location crammed with thousands of SF publications: novels, short story collections, and periodicals. Our goal with this database is to digitally document and publicize this amazing collection with on-campus researchers, regional communities, and eventually a transnational audience. While we’ve only made a small dent in cataloguing and categorizing the thousands of publications in CSSF, it is our goal to create a database for a wide variety of readers, from casual SF enthusiasts to academics engaged in scholarly research, to browse the collection virtually for the vast array of titles into which they might delve if they visit in person. We plan to continue adding details to eventually make the database searchable by subject matter, theme, and/or keywords.

We are also renovating the office next to CSSF as a drop-in reading room, and anticipate that bringing together an interdisciplinary mix of students, scholars, artist-practitioners, educators, and enthusiasts will lead to productive dialogues and future research opportunities.
